### Data Quality Framework

* **Completeness:** Refers to the extent to which all required data is present. Complete data includes all necessary fields, records, and values.

* **Consistency:** Refers to the degree to which data is uniform and in agreement across different sources and over time. Consistent data should not contradict itself or other sources.

* **Currency:** Refers to the timeliness of the data. Current data is up-to-date and reflects the most recent information available.

* **Relevancy:** Refers to the extent to which data is useful and applicable to the task at hand. Relevant data is aligned with the objectives and goals of the analysis.

* **Validity:** Refers to the extent to which data is accurate and relevant for the intended purpose. Valid data adheres to defined standards and criteria.
