# Data Insights
After completing the data cleaning task, we will be exploring the Sprocket Central Pty Ltd customer data set, which includes both old and new customers. Our goal is to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior that can inform the company's marketing and sales strategies. To do this, we will be using RFM analysis to segment the customer base and gain a deeper understanding of customer value and behavior.

## Process
1. **Data Exploration:** We will begin by exploring the data to gain a deeper understanding of the customer base and identify any patterns or trends that may be relevant to our analysis.
